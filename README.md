# Spadefoot_Genomics
This repository contains materials related to genomic investigations of Spadefoot toad biology.

# About
This repository contains my (https://orcid.org/0009-0000-6812-2360) code and scripts used for Spadefoot toad genomics projects. As it stands now, all documentation in this repository will be written for pre-existing open-access tools developed by other organizations or researchers. These scripts are being developed for handling, processing, and analyzing genomic data. I am making these documents public in order to allow other researchers to look for code/scripts to help them execute similar projects. No actual data is planned to be deposited here.

In the event that original or proprietary packages/code is developed for these projects, appropriate documentation may be posted here or in another repository as required by funding agency/publisher/primary investigators.
